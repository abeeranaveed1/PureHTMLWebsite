    <p> The kindest and most thoughtful, family-oriented protagonist. </p>
    <p> I've never liked the main character most but Tanjiro is by far my most favorite. </p>
    <p> He adores his family and does right by the, finds strength in their bonds and looks after those around him. </p>
    <p>He finds a way to be kind, even to the enemy </p>
