    <p> One of my all time favorite characters in anime itself - Kakashi Hatake the copy ninja </p>
    <p> He is the leader of Team 7 and one of the main characters. </p>
    <p> Hands down, the coolest character with some of the best entrances and skills </p>

    <h1> Why did I enjoy this? </h1>
    <p> This anime holds a lot of sentimental value for me since it was one of the first ones I watched</p>
    <p> The characters all get a chance to reveal their backstories, allowing the people watching to relate and connect to them </p>
