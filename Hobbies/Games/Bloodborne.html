        <h1> Bloodborne </h1>
        <h2> Synopsis </h2>
        <p> Bloodborne follows the player's character, a Hunter, through the decrepit Gothic, Victorian-era–inspired city of Yharnam, whose inhabitants are afflicted with a blood-borne disease. Attempting to find the source of the plague, the player's character unravels the city's mysteries while fighting beasts and cosmic beings.</p>

    <p> Father Gascoigne is an experienced hunter who has succumbed to the blood-drunkenness of the hunt and, as such, descended into a frenzied killing spree. </p>
    <p> What propelled me to this character was the tragic lore behind him </p>
    <p> He had descended to madness and killed his own wife, thinking she was a beast. </p>
