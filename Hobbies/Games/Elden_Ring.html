        <h2> Synopsis </h2>
        <p> Elden Ring sees you play as an initially meaningless character in a world of monsters and demigods, all struggling for control over the Lands Between. It's your job to explore the world, grow in strength, and fight or ally with those you meet to bring about a new order by collecting the Great Runes.</p>
