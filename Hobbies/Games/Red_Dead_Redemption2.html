<h1> Why did I enjoy this? </h1>
<p> The open world element of this game is endless and keeps you occupied for hours on end. </p>
<p> There is so much to discover, so many different encounters and how they play out according to how it is approached. </p>
<p>The open world is riddled with unsolved mysteries and easter eggs of the real world. </p>
<p> Even to this day, some mysteries of this game are yet to be unraveled. </p>
